                    <h4>Look and Feel, Insperation, Moleskine, Elegance</h4>
                
                    <p>"The love that the App Doodle people partnered up with Moleskine. Something about the simple, lightweight, and classy feel to this notebook inspires me to create!"</p>
                
                
                    <h4>Convenience</h4>
                
                    <p>"I used to scribble app ideas onto bar napkins. There was something gritty and fun about that, but now I carry this little book wherever I go. My ideas end up being more clear and  organized when I wake up the next day."</p>  
                
                
                    <h4>Organization</h4>
                
                    <p>"The App Doodle Pro is a must have for any modern day app developer. Having my app organized into different views helps me keep track of every thought I put into it."</p>
                
                    <h4>Productivity</h4>
                
                    <p>"You don't have to be a programmer to make your ideas come to life. Expressing your next million dollar app to an iOS developer couldn't be easier or more effective. Having each angle of my app designed ahead of time and organized in this book helped my programmer finish the app weeks before the deadline."</p>
                
                    <h4>Save Yourself Time and Money</h4>
                
                    <p>"Everybody in the app world knows that when you make a programmer change course half way through the development cycle, nobody wins. This notebook really helped me really iron out the kinks of my app in the design process which saved me time and money."</p>
