                    <p class="editorial">"I used to scribble app ideas onto bar napkins. There was something gritty and fun about that, but now I carry this little book wherever I go. My ideas end up being more clear and  organized when I wake up the next day."</p>

                    <p class="editorial">"You don't have to be a programmer to make your ideas come to life. Expressing your next million dollar app to an iOS developer couldn't be easier or more effective. Having each angle of my app designed ahead of time and organized in this book helped my programmer finish the app weeks before the deadline."</p>

                    <p class="editorial">"Everybody creating apps knows that when you direct your programmer to change course half way through the development cycle, progress gets delayed and the working relationship is never the same. This notebook really helps the designer iron out the kinks of an app in the design process, which prevents a lot of headaches."</p>
